# 🗣️ **VOXCOMM Intercom**
### Mesh based Intercom for Motorcycles and Beyond  
**Status:** *Under Development*

## 🚀 What Is VOXCOMM?
**VOXCOMM V1** is an **ESP-based MESH intercom and Bluetooth audio system** designed for motorcycles, group rides, or any situation where clear, hands-free communication matters.

At its core is **VOX MESH**, a proprietary mesh networking system that delivers:
- ⚡ **Ultra-low-latency audio**
- 🌐 **Long-range communication**
- 🔒 **Private or open group networks**
- 🧠 **Scalable connections** — from a few riders to potentially hundreds\*

VOXCOMM aims to rival the performance of leading intercom brands while remaining **customizable and affordable**.

- Compatible with most Bluetooth-enabled devices

### 🗣 **VOX (Voice over X-MESH)**
- Proprietary **multi-node mesh communication**
- **Private MESH groups** with user-defined credentials  
- **Open MESH mode** for public communication  
- **High-clarity 14.7 kHz / 16-bit stereo voice transmission**  
- Designed for **low latency** and **stable connectivity**

### ⚙️ **Device Interface**
- Integrated display for easy mode switching  
- **Voice Assist** announces modes when the display isn’t visible  
- Compact, power-efficient, and ready for future upgrades

## 🕸️ What Is MESH Networking?

A **mesh network** allows multiple devices — called *nodes* — to communicate directly with one another without relying on a central router.

           (VOX Node A)
              /    \
             /      \
    (VOX Node B)----(VOX Node C)
             \      /
              \    /
           (VOX Node D)

Each VOXCOMM device can relay information to others, creating **multiple communication paths**.  
If one device goes offline, data automatically finds a new route — keeping the network connected.

> Mesh networks are **robust, self-healing, and ideal for group communication on the move.**

## ⚔️ VOXCOMM vs. Traditional Systems (Cardo, Sena, etc.)

Unlike commercial intercoms that rely on **Bluetooth Mesh** or **Zigbee**, VOXCOMM uses a **custom mesh layer**.  
That means:
- 🚀 **Higher throughput** and **lower latency**  
- 📡 **Longer range**\*
- 🧩 **Potential for no fixed connection limit** — scale to your needs\*

VOXCOMM V1 focuses on **core performance and reliability** rather than feature bloat.

## 🧠 VOX MESH Capabilities
- 🔐 Create **private groups** with your own name and password  
- 🌍 Start an **open mesh** for anyone nearby to join  
- 🔄 Automatic **reconnect** and **self-healing** connections  
- 🎙 Seamless **multi-device audio routing** *(under optimization)*

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations
As development continues, a few limitations remain (but are being worked on):
- ❌ **Bluetooth and MESH** cannot currently run simultaneously. Bluetooth is disabled when in VOX mode (currently causes com disruption)  
- 📵 **HFP (Hands-Free Profile)** not yet supported — phone calls unavailable right now
- 🧰 **Hardware and firmware optimizations** still in progress  

These are all active areas of work and will improve in future builds.

---

## 🧩 Development Status *(as of Oct 2025)*
- ✅ Core MESH and Bluetooth functional  
- ⚙️ Audio optimization and stability improvements ongoing  
- 💡 PCB design phase beginning  
- 📶 Multi-device testing and range benchmarking underway
